Each review is associated with a label, which contains a wealth of information including the origin of the wine, the year it was bottled, the alcohol content, and other attributes. To get an idea of any areas with relatively higher or lower ratings, we looked into the ratings by country and alcohol content. The ratings ranged from 4 to 4.3, with the highest ratings coming from South Africa [4.3, NA%] and Argentina [4.25, 13.23%], and the lowest coming from the United States [3.99, 13.99%],  and Portugal [4, 14.61%].  It is worth noting that the lower rated wines appear to have slightly higher alcohol content. However, the data from these reviews give no indication regarding the origin of the reviewer, and are ultimately subjective. It could be the case that people in the lower rating countries tend to rate things lower, but we cannot know from this dataset.
